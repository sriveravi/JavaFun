# Nothing to see here, folks

These are some very non-exciting codes I wrote as exercises in teaching myself Java.  

Eearly ones were from some books I didn't like.  I really enjoyed _Head First Java (2nd Ed)_ and started studing from that.  It is good to get at the concepts quickly with clarity and refresh on the important OO ideas without going through painstaking detail of noob coding books.

So I repeat, nothing to see here folks.  Turn away.
